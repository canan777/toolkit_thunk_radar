✅Redux Toolkit Thunk Flight Radar Project

🛩 This is a web application that displays flight data on a map and allows users to see flight details.

🛬In the project, Redux Toolkit was used for case management and Axios was used for data development.

🛫React-Paginate is used to list a limited number of items per page and to navigate between pages.

✈️ This project provides both a map and a list view, allowing users to switch between them and access detailed information.
